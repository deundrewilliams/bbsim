# BBSim
---
BBSim is a simulator of the TV show Big Brother. In this show, there are 14-16 contestants that live in a house, and week by week, 1 by 1, someone is voted out of the house. During this process, a large amount of strategy, relationship building, and manipulation is involved. The purpose of this application is to replicate that behavior as closely as possible.
